    # +simple_matcher()+ makes it easy for you to create your own custom
    # matchers in just a few lines of code when you don't need all the power
    # of a completely custom matcher object.
    #
    # The description argument will appear as part of any failure message.
    #
    # The match block can have arity of 1 or 2. The first argument will be the
    # given value. The second, if the block accepts it will be the matcher
    # itself, giving you access to set custom failure messages in favor of the
    # defaults.
    #
    # If you set custom messages, you don't have to pass the description
    # argument to the simple_matcher method, but you must then provide any
    # messages that might get invoked directly to the matcher (see Example
    # with custom messages, below)
    #
    # The match_block should return a boolean: true indicates a match, which
    # will pass if you use +should+ and fail if you use +should_not+. false
    # (or nil) indicates no match, which will do the reverse: fail if you use
    # +should+ and pass if you use +should_not+.
    #
    # An error in the +match_block+ will bubble up, resulting in a failure.
    # This includes ExpectationNotMet errors (raised by +should+ and
    # +should_not+), so you can wrap other expectations in a +simple_matcher+
    # and they'll "do the right thing."
    #
    # == Example with default messages
    #
    # def be_even
    #   simple_matcher("an even number") { |given| given % 2 == 0 }
    # end
    #           
    # describe 2 do
    #   it "should be even" do
    #     2.should be_even
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # Given an odd number, this example would produce an error message stating
    # 'expected "an even number"", got 3'
    #
    # == Example with custom messages
    #
    # def rhyme_with(expected)
    #   simple_matcher do |given, matcher|
    #     matcher.description = "string rhymer"
    #     matcher.failure_message = "expected #{given.inspect} to rhyme with #{expected.inspect}"
    #     matcher.negative_failure_message = "expected #{given.inspect} not to rhyme with #{expected.inspect}"
    #     actual.rhymes_with? expected
    #   end

    #     nut.extend Rhymer
    #     nut.should rhyme_with("be gone")
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # The resulting failure message would be 'expected "pecan" to rhyme with
    # "be gone"'. (Grandma Rita would be proud!)
